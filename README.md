# random_code

Probably the dumbest idea I've ever had in my life.

What if you told Python the answer you wanted and asked it to generate executable Python code that output the result?

What if you gave it no structure in the generation and just asked it to randomly combine characters until something worked?

That would be a stupid idea.

But here it is.


To generate 10 code samples between 8 and 20 characters, which output `True`, here are the numbers:

Num Results: 10
Total Duration: 805.12
Avg Duration: 433.57
Avg Number of Tries: 24155430.6

And here are the samples:

* `"'&\t'<'2Op, ,VN!r'"`
* `'"+"\n<F\'8E\''`
* `'"l@;u\tu">\'\''`
* `' "/ttGaw"<\'YtV\''`
* `'0.<\n422 '`
* `'\t243>+.5'`
* `"9!='A5:rkAy'"`
* `'37>+6+\r9'`
* `"'UfI&m' <'cA_-J0'"`
* `'1%\r7<59\r'`
